This is a Kotlin/JVM based ontology build system.

It is at a really preliminary stage, the objective is to have a fully controllable and performant
build system for ontologies that does not require tweaking obscure configuration files, Makefilesâ€¦

This should also make updating the build system much more independent from the description of the build
itself and provide better ways to test and parallelize actions (promises promises).

It is using [[https://robot.obolibrary.org][Robot]] for many of its tasks.


It is released under a [[LICENSE.txt][BSD-3 clause license]].
